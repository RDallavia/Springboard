    "* This is an exploration of the performance of recurrent neural networks and long-short term memory nodes on data from the U.S. capital markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data were limited to monthly frequency and could easily be expanded to alternate timesteps and augmented with economic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The purpose was primarily to understand the coding of the network and not create an engine for trading decisions (don't use this for trading).\n",
    "\n",
    "* After tinkering with hyperparameters, we concluded that simpler models (i.e., fewer hidden layers) may produce better results, as simple models produced results consistent with our statistical intuition that this is a random walk, but more data could change this.\n",

    "* The activation function turned out to be a fascinating aspect of the model with hyperbolic tangent, 'tanh', potentially having a simplfying affect on the network not exhibited by 'softmax' or 'reLU.'"

    "We don't think anyone is going to get rich using this model. The training score essentially says our model memorized our data. Our test score is, as always, more interesting. The test score MSE increases with the number of periods our model looks back before making a decision. At a lookback of 4 months, our test MSE was an uninspiring .54. Yet, looking back 1 month yielded a test MSE of ~.20. This seems to lend credence to the view that the best point estimate of a random walk is the value from a comparable prior period. In our experience with this model, the opening price this month really was best predicted by the price the month prior. We can think of no reality in which this would change by using the closing value as a target.\n",
    "\n",
    "One should note that adding complexity only worsened the problem. Adding a 20 node dense layer pushed the test MSE back to ~.5 with a 'relu' activation function, but dropped back to .20 when the activation function was changed to 'softmax.' We do not believe model selection should be driven by the activation function, so we were unimpressed by this unexpected result. Removing the 20 intermediate, hidden layer and adding 20% dropout brought our test MSE back to .20 with 'relu' activation and 'softmax.' The only exception to our \"simpler is better\" contention occurred when we switched the activation function to 'tanh.' Hyperbolic tangent ('tanh') prevents gradient explosion and has output values of -1, 0, and 1. It's value is derived from the interplay of odd and even values defined by an exponential function. This restriction may simplify output such that the complexity of the model's network in masked. This question should be addressed in future research, as should some attempt at standardizing the activation functions chosen for different problems."
