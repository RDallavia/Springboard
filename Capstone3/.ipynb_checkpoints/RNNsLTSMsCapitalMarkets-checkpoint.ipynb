    "* Market prediction is an unsolved problem in n-dimensions and, thus, intrinsically fascinating.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is an exploration of the performance of recurrent neural networks and long-short term memory nodes on data from the U.S. capital markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data were limited to monthly frequency and could easily be expanded to alternate timesteps and augmented with economic or fundamental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The purpose was primarily to understand the coding of the network and not create an engine for trading decisions (don't use this for trading).\n",
    "\n",
    "* We concluded that simpler models (i.e., fewer hidden layers) do not produce better results than more complex networks. In fact, more information was associated worse performance (MSE = ~2.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The activation function turned out to have an outsized impact on our results with hyperbolic tangent yielding the worst performance and rectified linear unit performing best (MSE = ~.55).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Further research on the market prediction problem should focus on the ideal activation function, as well as the optimal amount and type of data."

    "We don't think anyone is going to get rich using this model. The training score essentially says our model did a mediocre job of memorizing the data. Our test score is, as always, more interesting. The test score MSE increases with the number of periods our model looks back before making a decision. At a lookback of 4 months, our test MSE was 1.79 with our hidden, 20-node layer and 'reLU' as an activation function. Retaining this setup and changing the activation function to 'tanh' yielded a more respectable test MSE of .63. In both cases, 'tanh' was our activation function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Running this setup with the extra hidden layer and 4-month lookback, but with 'relu', brought our MSE back up to an embarassing 2.13 on the test set versus .54 on the training set. Changing the activation function back to tanh brought the test MSE down to 1.35.  Eliminating the hidden layer and retaining a 4 month lookback and tanh yielded poor results (MSE = ~1.4). Finally, eliminating the hidden layer and returning to reLU with a 1-month look back yielded the best test set results (MSE = .36). This is oddly good and, we think, interesting. It seems to lend credence to the view that the best point estimate of a random walk is the value from a comparable prior period. Restated, the best model seems to be the simplest one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of the activation function was almost as striking as the look back period. The difference between the results with 'tanh' and 'relu' resulted in the difference between a model you'd throw away and one on which you'd continue to work. Further research on the market prediction problem should focus on the ideal activation function, as well as the optimal amount and type of data. Supplementing the data here with economic data and additional technical, as well as fundamental, data would also be fruitful. "
